COMMAND: awk

DESCRIPTION:
awk is a powerful text-processing command used to scan files or input line by line,
split each line into fields, and perform actions based on patterns.
In CTFs and cybersecurity tasks, awk is commonly used for parsing logs,
extracting specific fields, filtering outputs, and automating data analysis.

USAGE:
awk 'pattern { action }' file

COMMON AND USEFUL FLAGS / FEATURES:

1. {print}
Prints entire lines or specific fields.
Example:
awk '{print}' file.txt

2. $1, $2, $NF
Access specific fields in a line.
$1 = first field, $2 = second field, $NF = last field.
Example:
awk '{print $1, $NF}' users.txt

3. -F
Specifies a custom field separator.
Example (colon-separated files like /etc/passwd):
awk -F ':' '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd

4. /pattern/
Filters lines matching a pattern.
Example:
awk '/root/ {print}' /etc/passwd

5. BEGIN
Runs commands before processing input.
Example:
awk 'BEGIN {print "Start parsing"} {print $1}' file.txt

6. END
Runs commands after processing input.
Example:
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' numbers.txt

7. NR
Built-in variable representing line number.
Example:
awk '{print NR, $0}' file.txt

CTF AND CYBERSECURITY USE CASES:
- Extracting usernames or IDs from /etc/passwd
- Parsing log files to find suspicious activity
- Extracting flags from large text outputs
- Processing command output efficiently
- Automating repetitive filtering tasks

NOTES:
- awk works well with pipes (|)
- Combine awk with grep, sort, and uniq for powerful workflows
- Ideal for one-liners in time-limited CTF challenges
