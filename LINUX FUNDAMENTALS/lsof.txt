COMMAND: lsof (List Open Files)

DESCRIPTION:
Lists information about files opened by processes. Since "everything is a file" in Linux (including network sockets, pipes, and devices), this is the best tool to see what processes are actually doing or listening on the network.

COMMON FLAGS:
-i          : Lists IP sockets (network connections). Essential for checking active ports.
-n          : Inhibits conversion of network numbers to host names (makes output faster).
-P          : Inhibits conversion of port numbers to service names (e.g., shows '80' instead of 'http').
-u [user]   : Lists files opened by a specific user.
-p [pid]    : Lists files opened by a specific process ID.
+D [dir]    : recursively search for open instances of a directory.

USEFUL EXAMPLES:

1. See all active network connections (fast mode):
   lsof -i -n -P

2. Find out what process is using a specific port (e.g., port 80):
   lsof -i :80

3. See what files a specific user has open:
   lsof -u username

4. See every file/library a specific process is touching:
   lsof -p 1234
