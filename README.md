# Learn To Hack

Welcome to Learn_To_Hack! This repository is dedicated to building a comprehensive, open-source guide/handbook for anyone interested in learning CyberSecurity and participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

## 🚩 Project Vision

Our goal is to create a complete, community-driven handbook that covers everything from basic setups and theory to hands-on challenges. The content is organized into topic-based folders, and new topics will be added as the field evolves.

## 📂 How this works

Each topic folder contains:
- **Tasks**: Guided learning activities, explanations.
- **Challenges**: Practical problems to reinforce your understanding.

More folders and topics will be added in the future to keep the handbook up to date.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We welcome and encourage open source contributions! Contributors are asked to work on issues that will be raised in the repository. These issues will range from simple setups and theoretical explanations to hands-on challenges.
